# Migrations
This directory is where all database schema migrations are stored.

These initialize or update the database schema on each version.

The filenames in this directory comply with the recommended names in the [`diesel_migrations` documentation v1.4.0](https://docs.rs/diesel_migrations/1.4.0/diesel_migrations/).

See [/tooling/init_diesel_migration](/tooling/init_diesel_migration) for a tool that makes it more convenient to create new migration entries.
