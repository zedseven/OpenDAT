# To-Do
## Primary
- Basic interface
- Complete modification version control
- Test imports of data

## Secondary
- Import methods
- Dat generation
- Version update scripts for database (a means of upgrading db schema for new versions)
- Localization framework

## Tertiary
- Optional TLS (Rocket has a TLS feature - look into it, and enable it if the required certs are present)
- Set up a localization page (look into something like [Weblate](https://weblate.org/) or [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/))
- Look into setting up a GitHub Organization for the project, once something publishable is available
